   - Click "New Project"
   - Name: "Note Taking App" 
   - Click "Create"

3. **Enable Google Identity API**:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Library"
   - Search "Google Identity"
   - Click "Google Identity" and "Enable"

4. **Configure OAuth Consent Screen**:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "OAuth consent screen"
   - Choose "External" (for testing)
   - Fill required fields:
     - App name: "Note Taking App"
     - User support email: your email
     - Developer contact: your email
   - Click "Save and Continue" through all steps

5. **Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials**:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
   - Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs"
   - Application type: "Web application"
   - Name: "Note Taking App"
   - Authorized JavaScript origins:
     - `http://localhost:3000` (for development)
     - Add your production domain later
   - Authorized redirect URIs:
     - `http://localhost:3000` (for development)
   - Click "Create"

6. **Copy the Client ID** from the popup

### Step 2: Update Environment Variables (1 minute)

1. **Frontend (.env)**:
```bash
cd "C:\Users\Abhishek Singh\OneDrive\Pictures\Desktop\to test\new_assignment\note-taking-app\frontend"
```

Edit `.env` file and add your Google Client ID:
```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_ACTUAL_CLIENT_ID_HERE
```

2. **Backend (.env)**:
```bash
cd "C:\Users\Abhishek Singh\OneDrive\Pictures\Desktop\to test\new_assignment\note-taking-app\backend"
```

Edit `.env` file and add your Google Client ID:
```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_F9tIf4vVgJSU@ep-rough-water-a1tvercd-pooler.ap-southeast-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require&channel_binding=require
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-in-production
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_ACTUAL_CLIENT_ID_HERE
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
```

### Step 3: Start the Application (1 minute)

1. **Start Backend**:
```bash
cd "C:\Users\Abhishek Singh\OneDrive\Pictures\Desktop\to test\new_assignment\note-taking-app\backend"
npm run dev
```

2. **Start Frontend** (in new terminal):
```bash
cd "C:\Users\Abhishek Singh\OneDrive\Pictures\Desktop\to test\new_assignment\note-taking-app\frontend"
npm start
```

### Step 4: Test Your App! 🎉

1. **Open**: http://localhost:3000
2. **Test Email Signup**:
   - Click "Sign Up"
   - Enter email/password
   - Check email for OTP
   - Verify and login

3. **Test Google OAuth**:
   - Click "Continue with Google" on login page
   - Sign in with your Google account
   - Should redirect to dashboard

4. **Test Notes**:
   - Create a new note
